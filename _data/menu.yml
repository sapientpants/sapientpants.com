        These posts are generated using a custom built, automated research, writing and editing pipeline for me to learn about topics that interest me in the fields of artificial intelligence, engineering, and innovation. Through a process of continuous improvement I hope to end up with a system that can research a topic broadly and combine all of the research into a coherent summary with references.
