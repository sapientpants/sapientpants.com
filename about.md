Hi, I'm Marc Tremblay, a technologist and entrepreneur who's fascinated by the ways technology can transform how we live and work. My journey has taken me from coding search engines in Calgary to building AI solutions in Berlin's vibrant tech scene, with plenty of unexpected turns along the way - including my early studies in molecular biology, which taught me to look at complex systems from different angles.

Over the past two decades, I've had the privilege of bringing innovative ideas to life, whether through bootstrapping startups, developing intelligent tutoring systems, or exploring sustainable technology solutions. What gets me excited is seeing how cutting-edge technology can solve real-world challenges and create meaningful impact. Through this blog, I share my perspectives on technology trends, entrepreneurship, and the future of how we learn, work, and interact with the digital world.

## How was sapientpants created?

These posts are written with a custom built AI agent that supports me in researching, writing and editing the posts you see here. Once the initial report is generated, there are subsequent generations performed for meta descriptions and the post is formatted in Markdown before being published by Jekyll.

## Why was sapientpants created?

My motivation is to both gain insights into building such an AI agent and to learn about topics that interest me through the content of the agent-generated posts. I came to building my own agent after trying [gpt-researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher) and [STORM](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu) and deciding they weren't quite what I was looking for. I'm not there yet with my agent, but I have been learning a lot along the way. Hopefully some of the posts are also of interest to you.
