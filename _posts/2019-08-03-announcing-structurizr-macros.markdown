title: Announcing structurizr-macros
---

[Structurizr-macros](/structurizr-macros) is a project I started working on over a year ago to help me create Structurizr diagrams and documentation for my projects.

There isn't a whole lot more to say here other than to officially announce that the structurizr-macros project exists.
